## Overview of Darooch OS

1. **Tools from Buscador**:
   - The backbone of Darooch, providing the fundamental existence of this project. Bazzell is a legend. Michael Bazzell spent 18 years as a government computer crime investigator. During the majority of that time, he was assigned to the FBI‚Äôs Cyber Crimes Task Force where he focused on open-source intelligence and computer-based crime investigations. He currently lives and works in Washington, D.C., and serves as the technical advisor for the television hacker drama ‚ÄúMr. Robot‚Äù on the USA network. In anticipation of Season 2.

     - Optomized commands that perform multiple functions
